# ----------------------------------------------------------
# DESCRIPTION:
# 
# Takes a file: 
#Chr4A	27	A	G	0/1	0/0	0/1	0/0	0/1	0/1	Pat	Mat
#Chr4A	301	G	T	0/1	0/0	0/1	0/0	0/1	0/1	Mat	Pat
# Where the columns are chr, pos, ref, alt, grandfather, 
# grand-mother, parent, mother, father, child, line, block
# NOTE! Prefilter the file to keep only lines where the obs.
# line is DIFFERENT from the assigned blocks (potential NCO).
#
# Finds the expected base according to the block and the 
# observed base and print them as last columns.
