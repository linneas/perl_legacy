# Bugfixed 30 June 2015, didn't compare the parent haplotype
# between the two trios properly for the paternal line. 
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# DESCRIPTION:
# 
# Takes a file: 
#Chr4A   27      0/1     0/1     0/1     0/1     0/1     0/1
#Chr4A   30      0|0     0|0     0|0     0|0     0|0     0|0
#Chr4A   31      ./.     ./.     0|0     0|0     ./.     ./.
#Chr4A   55   	 1|0     0|0     0|1     1|0     0|0     1|0
# Where the columns are grandfather, grandmother, parent, 
# mother, father, child.
#
# Extracts positions where the allele in the child can be 
# traced back to one of the grandparents (for the linage in
# question, given as "M"=maternal or "P"=paternal.
# Valid positions would be if the grandparents are different
# from eachother, the parent is "0|1" or "1|0" (and similar
# to mother or father column, whichever it is), and the other 
# parent and offspring is NOT both "0|1" (or "1|0" or "0/1").
# Hence, it's not possible to have "0/1" in all three indi-
# viduals in a trio.
