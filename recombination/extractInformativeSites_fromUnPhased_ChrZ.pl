# Modified to handle ChrZ where the female individuals have
# a single chromosome. 
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# DESCRIPTION:
# 
# Takes a file: 
#ChrZ   27      0/1     0     0/1     1     0/1     0/1
#ChrZ   30      0/0     1     0/0     1     0/0     0/0
#ChrZ   31      ./.     1     0/0     0     ./.     ./.
#ChrZ   55   	1/0     0     0/1     1     0/0     1/0
# Where the columns are grandfather, grandmother, parent, 
# mother, father, child. (For chromosome Z the parent is
# always the father!)
#
# Extracts positions where the allele in the child can be 
# traced back to one of the grandparents (for the linage in
# question, given as "M"=maternal or "P"=paternal.)
# Valid positions would be if the grandparents are different
# from eachother, the parent is "0/1" (and similar to mother
# or father column, whichever it is), and the other parent
# and offspring is NOT both "0/1".
# Hence, it's not possible to have "0/1" in all three indi-
# viduals in a trio.
