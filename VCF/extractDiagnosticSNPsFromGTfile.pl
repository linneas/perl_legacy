# =========================================================
# Takes a list of individual names and a genotype file (a 
# condensed version of VCF that only contains scaffold, pos
# and one column per ind with it's allele (either the GT
# column (like 0/0 or 0) or translated to bases (like A/A 
# or A).
# Returns a list of SNPs where ALL the individuals on the
# list has one GT, and ALL the other inds has another. 
#
# NOTE: This version of the script assumes that one or more
# outgroups are included which will guarantee that when the
# selected (in)group has a unique SNP, it must be the derived
# allele (if one selects the outgroup, or doesn't include 
# an outgroup at all, the script will still work but the
# header "ANC" and "DER" has no meaning. (However changing
# it to "NON_SELECTED" and "SELECTED" makes it correct).
