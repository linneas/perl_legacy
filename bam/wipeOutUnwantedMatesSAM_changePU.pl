# Same as wipeOutUnwantedMatesSAM.pl but also change the
# PU header (given as input)
# Changed script 2017-02-08 to take a list of scaffolds 
# instead of fasta file!
# ========================================================
# Takes a samfile and a list with wanted scaffolds, and 
# check if each read is mapped to a wanted scaffold (other-
# wise throw away) and also control the mate - if mate
# maps to different scaffold, set mate to unmapped! 
# (By replacing the 7th column by "=" and also add "8" to
# the flag in column 2 (8="mate unmapped"). 
# If header is present, it's also filtered for unwanted 
# sequences. 
# ========================================================
