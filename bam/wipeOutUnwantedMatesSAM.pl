# Takes a samfile and a fasta with wanted scaffolds, and 
# check if each read is mapped to a wanted scaffold (other-
# wise throw away) and also control the mate - if mate
# maps to different scaffold, set mate to unmapped! 
# (By replacing the 7th column by "=" and also add "8" to
# the flag in column 2 (8="mate unmapped"). 
# If header is present, it's also filtered for unwanted 
# sequences.
