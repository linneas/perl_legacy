# =========================================================
# Takes a fasta and a list with changes (deletions, inserts
# and single base changes) which is based on the output 
# from samtools pileup (but modified first!) and infer the
# changes in the fasta sequence.
#
# The list should have the format:
# Name	Pos	Base	Change_base	Type	#Comment
# For example:
# scaffold1	140	A	C	change #
# scaffold1	201	*	T	delete_after	#
#
# for insertions and deletions, the third column should
# have an asterisk, and the inserted or removed base(s) 
# should be in column 4. The positions for these events are
# always reported as the position right BEFORE the event 
# (even for deletions! If pos 200 should be removed, write
# 199 in the second column).
