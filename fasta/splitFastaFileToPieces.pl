# ========================================================
# Takes a fasta file and splits it into several smaller 
# files with a given no of sequences in each. The output
# files are called prefix_start_end.fa, and are placed in
# an given directory.
# EDIT: ONLY WORKS WITH FASTA FILE THAT HAS THE SEQUENCE
# ON ONE LINE!!!
